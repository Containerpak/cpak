## 0. Notice on License Classification

This license provides full access to the source code, encourages public auditing and community collaboration, and imposes copyleft rules. However, because it includes a restriction on replicating the core purpose of *the Product*, it does **not** meet the Open Source Definition (OSD) by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

**FPAL** is best described as a **source-available**, **copyleft**, and **business-protective** license.

---

## 1. Purpose

This license ensures that *the Product* remains open, auditable, and improvable by the community, while protecting its ecosystem and brand identity.

---

## 2. Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to the conditions in this license.

The Software may be used for any purpose, including commercial and educational, provided that:

* Any distribution, modified or unmodified, must retain this license in full.
* The source code must be made available when the software is distributed or used to provide a public-facing service.

---

## 3. Copyleft Requirement

If you distribute the Software or modified versions of it, or deploy it to provide a network service:

* You must provide access to the complete source code of your version under the same license.
* You must clearly indicate all changes made.

This clause applies equally to traditional distribution and network use (in the spirit of AGPL).

---

## 4. Contributor Terms

* Contributors retain copyright to their work.
* By contributing, you grant *fabricators* and the public an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and redistribute the contribution under this license.
* Contributors must be identifiable as authors of their work, including via signed commits, verified identities on collaboration platforms, or similar traceable attribution methods.

---

## 5. Trademark and Naming Restrictions

This license does not grant permission to use the *Trademarks*.

Derivatives must not imply endorsement or official status unless separately permitted in writing by *fabricators*.

This license does not affect rights granted or withheld under applicable trademark law.

---

## 6. Purpose-Limited Use

To protect the integrity of *the Product* and its ecosystem, the following restriction applies:

You may **not** use the Software, in whole or in part, to create, distribute, or operate any product, system, or service whose primary function directly overlaps with or replicates the core business purpose of *the Product*, unless explicitly authorized in writing by *fabricators*.

This clause shall not prohibit:

* Incidental or academic use of the Software
* Use of isolated components for clearly unrelated purposes
* Internal evaluation or contribution to the public project

Determination of "core business purpose" shall be based on technical scope, user-facing objectives, and positioning in public or commercial contexts.

Violation of this clause constitutes a material breach and triggers immediate termination of rights granted by this license.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall *fabricators* be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Software.

---

## 8. Optional Commercial Terms

This license does not restrict your right to use the Software freely. However, *fabricators* may offer separate commercial agreements for closed-source integration, support services, or dual-licensed components.

---

## 9. Jurisdiction

This license shall be governed by the laws of Italy. Legal disputes shall be resolved in the courts where *fabricators* is headquartered.
